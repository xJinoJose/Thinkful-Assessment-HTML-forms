Assessment: HTML forms

Once you complete the assessment below, you will see a button allowing you to submit your answers and move on to the next lesson.

For this assessment, you will get the opportunity to build an email form. You'll need to create the following fields:

    Name
    Email
    Message

If you wish to add radio buttons, checkboxes, or a drop-down menu to include additional information, you are welcome to do so. Make sure that the web page with your form is hosted on GitHub, and publish it as a GitHub page. If you need a refresher on how to do this, review the GitHub introduction in the HTML and CSS fundamentals module or reach out to your peers. When you're done, submit a link to your solution work. Although you wonâ€™t be graded on this assessment, it is still required.
